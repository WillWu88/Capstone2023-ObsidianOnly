## I. Challenge

- Our challenge for the capstone design project is to design and implement an autonomous driving system for the _Picar_. 
- _Picar_ is a simple vehicle platform based on a RC model car and a Raspberry Pi. Various onboard sensors such as IMU, Lidar, and encoders are also included as needed. _Picar_ is designed by previous WashU Capstone Design projects.
- Our system will be timed and tested on an outdoor track. The system would be required to fulfill various autonomous navigation and race challenges.

## II. Project Deliverables

- The following deliberables are required for the project
	- 12 progress reports that track the progress of our work throughout the semester
	- 1 formal proposal 
	- 1 final presentation/competition run
	- 1 final written report, documenting our overall design, implementation and process
	- 1 final website, which presents all of our work interactively
- For us, we want to make our system as robust and fast as we can.
