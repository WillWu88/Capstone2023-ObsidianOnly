## Step 1: Making the original file in Solidworks 

- Completed a full remodeling of the current PiTop car on Solidworks utilizing the current specifications of the PiTop and adding in one set of screw holes for the Lidar mounting and adding one set of holes to mount the PiTop on the PiCar.

## Step 2: Redesign

- Created a redesign of the model to new preferred specs for an emphasis on speed.
	- Thinned out both the base of the PiTop and the platform.

- Also added in features to connect the halves of the PiTop together as the PiTop must be 3D printed in two parts due to printing size limitations.
	- First design has screw holes to connect the two halves.

## Step 3: 3D Printing in the Makerspace

[3D Printing Website](https://cloud.3dprinteros.com/#/files)

- The next step in 3D printing the PiTop is getting certified in the Jubel Makerspace.
	- Utilizing the link above, enrolled in the Jubel SLMP Makerspace extended learning canvas page.
	- Earned the “AY 2022-2023 Orientation”, “3D Printing – Know the Basics”, and “3D Slicing with PreForm (Form 3)” badges, which fulfills the requirements needed to be allowed to 3D print in the Makerspace.

- Then utilizing the 3D printerOs webpage, slice and queue up the 3D print .STL sketch for printing.

## Step 4: First Test of the New PiTop

- The two halves of the PiTop fit together well on the first trial, however with the error associated with the 3D printer the Lidar didn't fit into the Lidar screw spots.
	- For the second draft, there were holes for the Lidar screws to fall into before hitting the previous screw spot, which will allow for more secure mounting and for smaller screws to be used to fasten the Lidar.
	- In addition, in the second draft, screw spots were added for the PiHat to be mounted.
	- Also a remodel of the front car mounting pegs was completed to add more height.

- The two halves and the two front car mounts were sent to the 3D printer after being redesigned.

## Step 5: Second Test of New PiTop

- The Lidar fit into the screw spots and the raspberry Pi lined up properly this time.
	- More of convenience/security fixes:
		- Added screw drops so screws aren't sitting on the surface.
		- Added a drop for the Lidar motor.
		- Added a slit for the Lidar cord to go through.
		- Made the screw hexagon holes a bit smaller for more screw security.

## Step 6: Third Test of New PiTop

- Newest PiTop Model works and completes all of our specs.

- Needed to redesign the front mounts
	- Took off some of the height.

## Step 7: Mount Redesign

- The holes for the mount needed to be a bit higher and the spherical head needed to be shorter.

## Step 8: GPS Mount

- Added a GPS Mount to the front of car half of the PiTop, this is an optional improvement as only our group used the GPS.

## Conclusion

These were the steps taken to create and modify the PiTop and mounts for our purposes. All the .stl and .SLDPRT files are available in our team's [Github](https://github.com/WillWu88/Capstone-2023), so they can be modified and/or reprinted for the purpose of future projects.
